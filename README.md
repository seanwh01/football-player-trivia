## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. **Spin Position** → User picks: QB, RB, WR, TE, LB, CB, S, or DL
2. **Spin Year** → User picks: 2016-2024
3. **Spin Team** → User picks: Any of 32 NFL teams
4. **Guess Player** → User names the top player(s) at that position

**Example**:
- Position: Quarterback
- Year: 2023
- Team: KC (Chiefs)
- **Answer**: Patrick Mahomes

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Notes

### Database Queries Must Aggregate

**Football data is per-game, not per-season!**

Always use `SUM()` with `GROUP BY`:

```swift
SELECT player_name, SUM(offense_snaps) as total_snaps
FROM snap_counts
WHERE season = ? AND team = ? AND position IN (...)
GROUP BY player_id, player_name
ORDER BY total_snaps DESC
```

### Position Mapping

Map trivia positions to database codes:

```swift
"Quarterback" → ["QB"]
"Running Back" → ["RB", "HB", "FB"]
"Wide Receiver" → ["WR"]
"Tight End" → ["TE"]
"Linebacker" → ["LB", "ILB", "MLB", "OLB"]
"Cornerback" → ["CB", "DB"]
"Safety" → ["S", "SS", "FS"]
"Defensive Line" → ["DE", "DT", "DL", "NT"]
```

### All 32 NFL Teams

AFC: BUF, MIA, NE, NYJ, BAL, CIN, CLE, PIT, HOU, IND, JAX, TEN, DEN, KC, LAC, LV  
NFC: DAL, NYG, PHI, WAS, CHI, DET, GB, MIN, ATL, CAR, NO, TB, ARI, LA, SF, SEA
